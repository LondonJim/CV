My love of coding started as a child, making games for fun and it is only recently I decided to pursue a career in code. I have achieved a degree, a diploma and have experienced a range of different work environments, working with people from all walks of life. Now that I have completed Makers Academy, I am fully invested in and excited about keeping the code momentum going and putting my skills into action.


## Skills

**Motivated** -
Whenever I start something new, I am highly motivated and committed to achieve the best I can. I strive to understand all aspects of what I am learning by being thorough and organised. My motivation comes from my enjoyment of learning new things and applying them to real world situations. I taught myself about PC building using a variety of methods (tutorials, trying out for myself and general troubleshooting). I completed a diploma and gained other qualifications whilst working full time. Since finishing the Makers course, I have continued to expand my knowledge and have completed a variety of projects.

**Creative** -
I can use a range of creative ways to achieve desired outcomes. During the final project at Makers, I had many ideas about the design and code structure of our game, which the team took onboard with a highly successful outcome. Working in a school as a learning support worker meant that I had to be constantly thinking of creative ways to engage children in their learning. My job as a teaching assistant gave me opportunities to take responsibility for all classroom displays for the team and set design for the end of year production. I was also asked to teach lessons to the children including art lessons. I have also designed various artwork for album covers, band posters and football training camp posters. My creativity also extends to photography, again teaching myself to use a digital SLR camera. I was asked to take staff portraits which I edited using Adobe Lightroom. My music work over the years has involved many studio recording sessions and live performances with our work also featured on console releases through our publishing deal.

**Collaborative** -
I work well with all people. I am open minded, patient and approachable. I have experience working collaboratively in a range of different types of teams, whether following instruction from senior members or being in charge of a team myself. People respond well to my calm demeanour and my ability to talk problems and situations through, taking onboard suggestions and new ideas to achieve the best outcomes.

During my time at Makers I enjoyed working within a team and completing projects within a given timeframe. Working with Agile methodologies and processes, I found was a great way to work and from fellow Makers I received excellent feedback about my clear explanations and positive attitude, motivating other members in the group.
